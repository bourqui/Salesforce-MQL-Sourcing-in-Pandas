# Salesforce-MQL-Sourcing-in-Pandas

This project explores how Marketing Qualified Leads (MQLs) are sourced from Salesforce campaigns. It demonstrates pulling data from the Salesforce API, cleaning and transforming campaign data, and analyzing attribution using UTM parameters and lead source fields.

**Key elements:**
- API authentication using `pandaforce`
- Data cleaning and standardization in Pandas
- Exploratory analysis of UTM parameters and lead sources
- Markdown-rich Jupyter notebook with inline commentary

**Files/Structure**
- `MQL source campaign project.ipynb`: Main analysis notebook
- `README.md`: Project overview
- Screenshots of output included for clarity

**What I gained from this project:**
- Improved working with third-party APIs
- Practiced data cleaning best practices
- Learned to better document and structure notebooks for external readers

_All sensitive data (credentials, client names, lead info) have been removed or anonymized._
